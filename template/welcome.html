                      Hi everyone, my name is Linh. I live in Seattle and will be
                      attending University of Washing (Seattle campus) for upcoming
                      fall quarter. I am thinking to do Human Center Design Engineer,
                      or Cartooning, if I can't get in Computer Science Department. I
                      just got introduce to the idea of computer science (coding) this
                       year and still not too familiar, but working my way there. I
                       was born in Vietnam but I'm not full Vietnamese, I am part
                       Taiwanese(Chinese) and Cambodian. I came here when I was eleven.
                       I can speak about 4 languages (I think). I draw and enjoy taking
                       picture (just started this year). I play tennis, golf and bike
                       during my free time. I also play violin. Oh, I am also a social
                       media addict haha. There's no TV at my house, so I didn't really
                       watch TV shows that much beside: Pretty Little Liars, The Fosters,
                       Young and Hungry, The 100.

                    Hey everybody! My name is Steven and I will be travelling from
                    Denver, Colorado to Seattle! Next year, I will be attending
                    Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and studying Computer
                    Science. I love sports from tennis to ultimate frisbee, so you
                    know I'm going to bring one up to Seattle, but I also love to
                    play video games with friends and watch any kind of Marvel movie
                    or TV show. Now that high school and all of its stress is over,
                    I'm pumped to meet every single one of you in July!﻿</div>
